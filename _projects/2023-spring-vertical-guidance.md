In my second semester of freshman year I joined Cornell Hyperloop on the Structures Subteam of the Mechanical Team. Here, my freshman project was to desgin a guidance structure and choose wheels for it that would attach to the frame of the chassis and hold up the pod on top of the track that it is meant to rest on. This was a simple project and although my design was fine, I made it more complex than necessary. What I made was something more likely to be CNCed than the design we went with in the end. That design was basically a large plate with section cut out and holes for screws in it. Everything could be done on one of the mills within the machine shop. No fuss no muss. This was a good lesson in simplicity sometimes being key.
